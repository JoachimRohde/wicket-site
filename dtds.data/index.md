The following are the Document Type Definitions and XML Schema Definitions which you can use
for Wicket 1.3.x, 1.4.x and 1.5.x respectively.

These definitions are not used by Wicket for its internal working but you can use them in your
HTML/XML editor to simplify the development of your pages/panels markup.

* [Wicket 1.3 DTD](wicket-xhtml1.3-strict.dtd)
* [Wicket 1.4 DTD](wicket-xhtml1.4-strict.dtd)
* [Wicket 1.5 XSD](http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/wicket/repo?p=wicket.git;a=blob_plain;f=wicket-core/src/main/resources/META-INF/wicket-1.5.xsd;hb=wicket-1.5.x)
