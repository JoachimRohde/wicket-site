  <h1 id="wicket7">Apache&nbsp;Wicket v7.0 released</h1>
  <p>The Apache Software Foundation announces Apache Wicket™ v7.0 Open Source Java web framework that powers thousands of web applications and web sites for governments, stores, universities, cities, banks, email providers, and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="l-first">
  <p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced Apache™ Wicket™ v7.0, the Open Source Java web framework for high performance, scalable, component oriented web applications. 
This marks the seventh major release of the project that celebrated its 10 year anniversary last year.</p>
  <p>This framework allows Java developers to write web applications using components. 
This way developers can reason about the user interface in user interface building blocks, making it easier to link specific user interactions to server-side code. 
Wicket is a high performance framework processing billions of requests daily across the world.</p>
  <p>“With this release we have added a major improvement to our framework, making development with Wicket even easier.”, said Martijn Dashorst, Vice President of Apache Wicket.
“By adding ‘Component Queuing’ we have divorced the strict relationship between the Java component classes and the markup. This has been a headache for many users and sparked one of the longest discussions on our community lists. We finally put this issue to bed.”</p>
  <p>“Other major improvements are the move towards Java 7, newer Java EE standards, security features and the addition of new components. Wicket now bundles a cross site request forgery (CSRF) prevention measure, and provides support for inline images using the data: protocol,” continued Martijn Dashorst.</p>
  <p>Apache Wicket v7.0 reflects over 2 years of development, testing and feedback from hundreds of knowledgable users, bringing a highly stable, production ready release of the popular web framework.
The release consist of almost 300 features, improvements and fixes. In accordance with Semantic Versioning, this major release contains <a href="http://s.apache.org/wicket7migrate">several documented API breaks</a>. Following the Semantic Versioning standard, future minor releases of Wicket v7 will remain API compatible.</p>
  <p>You can start using <a href="start/wicket-7.x.html">Apache Wicket v7.0</a> now.</p>
  <p>Have fun!</p>

    <h1 id="introduction">Introducing Apache&nbsp;Wicket</h1>
    <p>Invented in 2004, Wicket is one of the few survivors of the Java
    serverside web framework wars of the mid 2000's. Wicket is an open
    source, component oriented, serverside, Java web application framework.
    With a history of over a decade, it is still going strong and has a
    solid future ahead. Learn why you should consider Wicket for your next
    web application.</p>
</div>
<div class="l-first">
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <img src="/img/java-wicket-html5.png" class="l-full" />
        <h3>Just Java &amp; HTML</h3>
        <p>Leverage what you know about Java or your favourite HTML 
        editor to write Wicket applications. With pure Java code and HTML 
        markup Wicket is the go-to web framework for purists.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <img src="/img/wicket-safe.png" class="l-full" />
        <h3>Secure by Default</h3>
        <p>URLs do not expose sensitive information and all component paths are
        session-relative. Wicket keeps your model private except those parts
        you explicitly expose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <img src="/img/wicket-components.png" class="l-full" />
        <h3>AJAX Components</h3>
        <p>Write Ajax applications without having to write a single line 
        of JavaScript code. Wicket's Ajax functionality makes it trivial 
        to update selected parts of a UI, and comes with a great selection 
        of basic Ajax components.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="l-first">
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>Open Source with Apache License</h3>
        <p>Since its inception in 2004 Wicket has been an open source
        project and remains available under one of the most permissive
        licenses: the Apache Software License.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>Maintainable code</h3>
        <p>Pages and Components in Wicket are real Java objects that support
        encapsulation, inheritance and events. Create high level components
        with ease and bundle its stylesheets, JavaScript and other resources
        into one reusable package.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>Internationalized to take on the world</h3>
        <p>With support of over 25 languages out-of-the-box, Wicket let's 
        you get started in your own language, or a second language with no 
        effort. You can provide alternative languages on the application, 
        page, or even component level.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="l-first">
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>Multi-tab and window support</h3>
        <p>No more pain while keeping taps on multiple tabs and windows. 
        Wicket's automatic state storage ensures that your users can open 
        pages in new tabs and windows without causing problems.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-two-third">
        <h3>Work with JavaScript and CSS</h3>
        <p>Global JavaScript libraries and CSS styling mix properly with 
        component local JavaScript and CSS resources. You can use custom 
        component libraries that ship with default JavaScript behaviour and 
        CSS styling, without having to do anything yourself. Creating such 
        self-contained component libraries is as easy as creating a JAR 
        file.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="l-first">
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>Test your pages and components</h3>
        <p>With WicketTester you can achieve testing coverage your QA 
        department can only dream of. Test your pages without having to run 
        inside a browser, or start a container. Test your components directly, 
        check their rendered markup tags, attributes and contents with ease.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>Injection support</h3>
        <p>Inject your services into your pages and components with the 
        technology of your choosing: Wicket provides integration with CDI 
        (JSR-305), Spring and Guice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="l-one-third">
        <h3>JavaEE integration</h3>
        <p>If you are using the Web profile of JavaEE 6 or newer, you can 
        leverage JPA, EJBs, Bean Validation and CDI with Wicket's integrations 
        for these specifications.</p>

        <h2>Apache Wicket 7.1.0 released</h2>
        <small>25 Oct 2015</small>
        <p>The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket 7.1.0!</p>
<p>This release marks another minor release of Wicket 7. We
use semantic versioning for the development of Wicket, and as such no
API breaks are present breaks are present in this release compared to
7.0.0.</p>
<h4 id="new-and-noteworthy">New and noteworthy</h4>
<p>Significant improvement in performance while adding components to
the component hierarchy. There was a regression in performance
introduced by component queuing. The algorithm checked if there were
any components to be dequeued, but did so in a O(n^2) way. This was
fixed.</p>
<p>Upon further investigation we found that adding components is O(n^2)
since 1.3 (when memory was scarce and expensive). We fixed that and
made it roughly O(1).</p>
<p>This means that when you have a page with 10k components on it, the
adding won’t slow you down any more, and the new way of adding
components will scrape a few ms off your overall average response time.</p>
<p>This release also fixes several bugs where head sections were not rendered,
i18n JavaScript resources could not be loaded, Range: header parsing and
a couple of component queuing issues.</p>
<h4 id="using-this-release">Using this release</h4>
<p>With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don’t forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):</p>
<dependency>
    <groupid>org.apache.wicket</groupid>
    <artifactid>wicket-core</artifactid>
    <version>7.1.0</version>
</dependency>
<p>Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="upgrading-from-earlier-versions">Upgrading from earlier versions</h4>
